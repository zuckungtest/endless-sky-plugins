<br>

<br>

Modifies the self destruction chance of Sestor and Mereti ships to a value of 0.0 (0%).<br>

<br>

Sestor 349/109/78/71/53/27/14 and Mereti 512/256/128/64/32/16/8 ships have a self destruction value of 0.0 (0%) now.<br>

You can easily change the values in automata.txt for each ship ('"self destruct" .0') to a value of your choice. I.e. 0.12 is 23%, 0.3 is 51%, 0.5 is 75%. Its calculated twice, first the chance for self destruction on boarding(i.e. 0.3) is 30%, then of the remaining 70% again 30% chance for self destruction on capturing. That makes 30% + 21% = 51% overall chance for self destruction on a capturing try.<br>

Adds several new start options with different ships, background stories, credits and debts.<br>

<br>

<ul>

<li>Start: Trader | Freighter: equipped for cargo transport, in Merak system</li>

<li>Start: Trader (Hai) | Aphid: equipped for cargo transport, in Fah Soom system(Hai space)</li>

<li>Start: Passenger Transport | Scout: equipped for passenger transport, Talita system</li>

<li>Start: Miner | Sunder: equipped for mining, in Rasalhague system</li>

<li>Start: Salvager | Shuttle: equipped for boarding, in Aldhibain system</li>

<li>Start: Salvager(big) | Argosy: equipped for boarding, in Aldhibain system</li>

<li>Start: Explorer to Remnant | Heavy Shuttle: equipped for exploring the Remnant, in Tania Australis system</li>

<li>Start: Explorer to Automata | Bounder: equipped for exploring the Kor Automata, in Mirfak system</li>

<li>Start: Cheater 1 | Heron + 10xKIV: 1b credits, full visible human space, Jump Drive, in Sol system, no story</li>

<li>Start: Cheater 2 | Heron + 10xSkylark: 1b credits, full visible human space, Jump Drive, in Sol system, no story</li>

</ul>

<br>

Beside the cheater start options, all others are balanced and lore friendly. A bigger ship means a bigger bank loan. All starts come with 200.000 credits cash and a bank loan between 600.000 and 4,5 million credits. The ships outfits are changed to fit the role. The intro missions on New Boston are set as completed. Same goes for the Hai start with the Hai first contact mission.<br>
